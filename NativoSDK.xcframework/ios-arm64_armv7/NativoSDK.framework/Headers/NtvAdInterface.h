 @discussion This will optionally be displayed only if the ad returned uses audience data targeting. The AdChoices button will click-out to a Nativo website that explains AdChoices and audience targeting. If the ad doesn't use targeting, then this view will be set to zero height and width. Your ad view should handle this by setting appropriate constraints to handle this change in size. Will add 3px insets on each side. Recommended 20x20 width and height. You can test this by calling `NativoSDK.enableTestAdvertisementsWithAdType(NtvTestAdTypeAdChoicesDisplay)`.
