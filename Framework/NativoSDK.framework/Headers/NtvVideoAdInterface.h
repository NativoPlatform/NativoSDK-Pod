    mode when a video goes fullscreen, and also in order to allow muted videos to be played without pausing background audio.
 
While Nativo will handle the audio session for videos that we control, it is up to you to manage the session for your own videos. We highly recommend that you import AVFoundation and change the AVAudioSessionCategory to `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback` whenever a video in your app is played. This will prevent background audio from overlapping with the foreground video.

Doing so will enable any background audio to resume playing.
