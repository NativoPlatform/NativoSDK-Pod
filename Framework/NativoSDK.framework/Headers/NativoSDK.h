/**
 The `NativoSDK` is used to retrieve true native, native display, standard display and video ads from Nativo. The NativoSDK is packed with features that will help you integrate native ads in your feed in a short amount of time.
 
 The NativoSDK has two main APIs for injecting ads into your views. The first is the table/collection view API, the second is the View API. The Table/Collection view API works by allowing it to manage how your cells get dequeued from a `UITableView` or `UICollectionView`. This is the most streamlined and convenient API for getting ad injected into your feed in no time. The View API works by simply passing in a `UIView` container which will be injected with ad content. In both APIs, the ad's view will be created using a nib that you registered previously using [NativoSDK registerNib:forAdTemplateType:], or via the `NtvSectionDelegate` method `registerNibNameForAdTemplateType:atLocationIdentifier:`.
 
 __Version__: 5.2.2
