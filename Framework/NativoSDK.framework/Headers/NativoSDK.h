/**
 The `NativoSDK` is used to retrieve true native, native display, and video ads from Nativo. The NativoSDK is packed with features that will help you integrate native ads in your feed in a short amount of time.
 
 The NativoSDK has two main APIs for injecting ads into your views. The first is the table/collection view API, the second is the View API. The Table/Collection view API works by allowing it to manage how your cells get dequeued from a `UITableView` or `UICollectionView`. This is the most streamlined and convenient API for getting ad injected into your feed in no time. The View API works by simply passing in a `UIView` container which will be injected with ad content. In both APIs, the ad's view will be created using a nib that you registered previously using [NativoSDK registerNib:forAdTemplateType:], or via the `NtvSectionDelegate` method `registerNibNameForAdTemplateType:atLocationIdentifier:`.
 
 __Version__: 4.3.6
