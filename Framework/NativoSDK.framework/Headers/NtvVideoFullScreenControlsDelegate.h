/**
 The `NtvVideoFullScreenControlsDelegate` is an optional protocol that should be adopted if you intend to create your own user interface for video controls. By default the NativoSDK will automatically use Nativo's own built in video controls, however if you need to match the look and feel of your app you can create your own UI by creating a view that implements this protocol. You would then need to call [NativoSDK setCustomFullScreenVideoControlsView:] to set your player as the new default.
